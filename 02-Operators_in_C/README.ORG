* Intorduction to Operators in C 
Write a program to find the area of the rectangular garden provided that the length of the rectangular garden is 15 meters and breadth is 10 meters.
- ~15 * 10~
Write a program to check if annual turnover of your company is grater than or equal to the annual turnover of your competitor.
- ~300000000 >= 50000000~
Write a program to make a decision that if you have both chair and table then you start studying your favorite subject otherwise you simpley go to sellp.

** WHY I AM DISUSSING ALL THESE PROGRAMS?
- ~15 * 10~ - Arithmetic operator
- ~300000000 >= 500000000~ - Relational operator
- ~if(🪑&&⛩𓊳)~ - Logical operator

|-------------------------------+------------------------|
| Name of Operatros             | Operators              |
| Arithmetic operators          | +,-,*,/,%              |
| Increment/decrement operators | ++,--                  |
| Relational operators          | ~==, !=, <=, >=, <, >~ |
| Logical operators             | *1                     |
| Bitwise operators             | *2                     |
| Assignment operators          | *3                     |
| Other operators               | ~?: &  * sizeof() ,    |

- 1) ~&&, ||, !~
- 2) ~&, ^, |, ~, >>, <<~
- 3) ~=, +=, -=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=~

* Arithmetic Operators in C
** ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
- ~+, -, *, /, %~
|---+----------------|
| + | addition       |
| - | Subtraction    |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division       |
| % | Modulus        |

All are binary operators, means two operands are required to perform operation.
- For example:
  - A + B
  - Op1 + Op2
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a, b;
  printf("Enter the first number: ");
  scanf("%d", &a);
  printf("Enter the second number: ");
  scanf("%d", &b);

  printf("a/b=%d\n", a/b);
  printf("a%%b=%d\n", a%b);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

** OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY
|-----------+---------------+------------|
| Operators | Associativity | Precedence |
| *,/,%     | Left to right | Highest    |
| +,-       | Left to right | Lowest     |
NOTE: Associativity is used only when two or more operators are of same precedence.
- For example: +,-
Same precedence therefroe we use associativity.
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5;
  printf("a*b/c=%d\n", a*b/c);
  printf("a+b-c=%d\n", a+b-c);
  printf("a+b*d-c%%a=%d", a+b*d-c%a);
  return 0;
}
