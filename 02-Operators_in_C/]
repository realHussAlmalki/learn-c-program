- ~300000000 >= 500000000~ - Relational operator
- ~if(🪑&&⛩𓊳)~ - Logical operator

* Arithmetic Operators in C
** ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
- ~+, -, *, /, %~
|---+----------------|
| + | addition       |
| - | Subtraction    |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division       |
| % | Modulus        |

All are binary operators, means two operands are required to perform operation.
- For example:
  - A + B
  - Op1 + Op2
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a, b;
  printf("Enter the first number: ");
  scanf("%d", &a);
  printf("Enter the second number: ");
  scanf("%d", &b);

  printf("a/b=%d\n", a/b);
  printf("a%%b=%d\n", a%b);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

** OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY
|-----------+---------------+------------|
| Operators | Associativity | Precedence |
| *,/,%     | Left to right | Highest    |
| +,-       | Left to right | Lowest     |
NOTE: Associativity is used only when two or more operators are of same precedence.
- For example: +,-
Same precedence therefroe we use associativity.
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5;
  printf("a*b/c=%d\n", a*b/c);
  printf("a+b-c=%d\n", a+b-c);
  printf("a+b*d-c%%a=%d", a+b*d-c%a);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

* Inrement and Decrement Operators in C
** WHAT ARE INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS?
Increment operator is used to increment the value of a variable by one. Similarly, decrement operator is used to decrement the balue of a variable by one.

|------------+------------|
| Increment  | Decrement  |
| int a = 5; | int a = 5; |
| a++;       | a--;       |
| a = 6      | a = 4      |

- ~a++; is same as a = a + 1;~
- ~a--; is same as a = a - 1;~

** INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS
- Both are unary operators.
  - because they are applied on single operand. ~a++;~ 
|------------------------+-------------------------|
| Pre-increment operator | Post-increment operator |
| ++a;                   | a++;                    |

|------------------------+-------------------------|
| Pre-decrement operator | Post-decrement operaotr |
| --a;                   | a--;                    |

You cannot use rvalue before or after increment/decrement operator.
Example:
- (a + b)++; error!
- ++(a + b); error!
  Compiler is expecting a variable as an increment operand but we are providing an expression (a+b) which does not have the capability to store data.

*lvalue (left value)*:simply means an object that has an identifiable location in memory (i.e. having an address).
*rvalue (right value)*:simply means an object that has no identifiable location in memeory.

*Question:* What is the difference between pre-increment and post-increment operator OR pre-decrement and post-decrement operator?
Pre - means first increment/decrement then assign it to another variable.
Post - means first assigne it to another variable then increment/decrement.

|----------+----------|
| x = ++a; | x = a++; |

|---+---+---|
| x |   | 5 |
| 6 |   | 6 |
| x | = | 6 |

|---+---+---|
| x |   | 5 |
| 5 |   | 6 |
| x | = | 5 |

- Q1: What is the output of the following C program fragement?
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 4, b = 3;
  printf("%d", a+++b); //[a] [++] [+] [b] -> [a++] [+] [b] = [4++] [+] [3] -> [5] [+] [4] = 8
  // Post increment/decrement in context of eauation
  // First use the value in the equatin and then increment the value
  // 7
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

- Q2: What is the output of the following C program fragement?
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 4, b = 3;
  printf("%d", a + ++b);
  //8
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

- Q3: What is the output of the following C program fragement?
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 4, b = 3;
  printf("%d", a+++++b);
  //Error
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

* Relational Operators in C

|------+--------------------------|
| ~==~ | Equal to                 |
| ~!=~ | Not eqaul to             |
| ~<=~ | Less than or equal to    |
| ~>=~ | Greater than or equal to |
| ~<~  | Less than                |
| ~>~  | Greater than             |

Used for comparing two values
- All realational will return either Ture or False.
- ~4==5~ is equivalent to is ~4==5~? -> Answer: False
- ~4!=5~ is equivalent to is ~4!=5~? -> Answer: True
#+begin_src c
int a = 300, b = 2090;

if (___>=___)
  {
    printf("Bingo! You are in");
  } esle
  {
    printf("OOPS! You are out");
  }
#+end_src

* LOGICAL OPERATORS

- ~&&~ AND
- ~||~ OR
- ~!~ NOT

~&&~ and ~||~ are used to combine two conditions. ~&&~ - return TRUE when all the conditions under consideration are true and returns FALSE whenany one or more than one condition is false.
#+begin_src c
int a = 5;
if (a == 5 && a != 6 && a <= 56 && a > 4)
  {
    printf("Welcome to this beautifull world of operators");
  }
#+end_src

~||~ - returns TRUE when one or more than one codition under consideration is true and returns FALSE when all conditions are false.
#+begin_src c
int a = 5;
if (a == 5 || a != 6 || a <= 56 || a > 4)
  {
    printf("Welcome to this beautifull world of operators");
  }
#+end_src

~!~ operator is used to complement the condition under consideration. ~!~ - returns TRUE when condition is FALSE and returns FALSE when condition is TRUE.
#+begin_src c
int a = 5;
if (!(a == 6))
  {
    printf("Welcome to this beautiful world of operators");
  }
#+end_src

** CONCEPT OF SHORT CICUIT IN LOGICAL OPERATORS
Short circuit in case of ~&&~: simply means if there is a condition anywhere in the expression that returns false, then the rest of the conditions after taht will not be evaluated.
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 5, b = 3;
  int incr;

  incr = (a<b) && (b++);
  printf("%d\n", incr);
  printf("%d", b);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 5, b = 3;
  int incr;

  incr = (a>b) && (b++);
  printf("%d\n", incr);
  printf("%d", b);
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

Short circuit in case of ~||~: simply means if there is acondition anywhere in the expression that returns True, then the rest of the conditions after that will not be evaluated.
